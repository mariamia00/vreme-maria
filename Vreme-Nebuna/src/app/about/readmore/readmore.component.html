   <div class="despre"><p>Weather is a fascinating subject. On a clear spring morning, the sun's rays pierce through the curtain of clouds and gently illuminate everything around. A light and fresh breeze fills the air, and the birds start their serenade, adding a musical note to nature. People begin to step out of their houses with smiles on their faces and lighter clothing. In contrast, a winter day can bring a white landscape and the crunch of snow underfoot. The penetrating cold prompts people to wrap themselves in thick clothes, and inside homes, a welcoming warmth from the stove or radiator is felt. Lastly, summer announces its presence with its heat, the sun blazing strongly overhead. Pools and beaches become popular destinations, and the evening brings coolness and pleasant nights spent outdoors. In each season, the weather surprises us with different aspects, influencing our mood and daily activities. Climate change refers to long-term alterations in Earth's climate patterns. These changes can include increases in global average temperatures, shifts in precipitation patterns, rising sea levels, and other environmental effects. They are largely attributed to human activities, especially the emissions of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, which contribute to global warming and influence climate systems. Many organizations, including the United Nations and the scientific community, monitor and research these changes to understand their impact and to develop strategies for adaptation and mitigation.</p></div>
