          Know your weather. Weather is important. We display forecast for 6
          days, provide world-wide map, posts area for users to have fun,
          aaaaand...we're still working on it . Maybe.
        </p>

          We are a small group of struggle-to-be programmers and created this
          wesbite as a project. It became fun, so now the website is online. And
          it's still hard to make it work properly lol.

      Go to UYW (Upload Your Weather), take a pic of your weather and show it to
      the world (no one will see it probably XD). <br />
      We are still working on the comment section (if we don't get lazy). So
      don't worry, nobody will be able to say a bad word about your post (￣▽￣)
    </li>
    <li class="my-3">
      You will need to create an account in order to be able to access UYW, just
      invent an email and a password. Oh, and don't forget it because we don't
      do email verifications and password recovery. Invent a name too, we barely
      care who you are (￣ω￣)
    </li>
    <li>
      Don't add your private info on website like your age, real full name, your
      home address, card details etc.. We are not responsible for your data
      exposure and will never ask you to provide your private information.
    </li>
    <li class="my-3">
      BUT, if you really lose password and for some reason want to get access to
      your useless account again, you can write us in the Contact section and we
      will reset your password, remember to give us an email you can really
      access so we can give you the new password
    </li>
